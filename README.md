# JavaOrbits
Simulation of orbits around a solar system to a high level of accuracy.

## Progress
<ul>
  <li> Keplars First Law implemented allowing for elliptical orbits to be drawn.
</ul>

## ToDo
<ul>
  <li> Calculate the correct angular acceleration of an orbit and move the planet accordingly.
  <li> Allow for the user to move around the system (should be easy as all orbit coords are relative to sun).
  <li> Scale properly with universe.
  <li> Allow to zoom in and view planets, having the camera follow the planet round.
  <li> Have planets looking visually appealing.
  <li> Tidy Code.
</ul>
